You can also share basic personality traits determined by our A.I. tests, though by making this information accessible, it becomes accessible to anybody in your friends circle.
	We also do not share your personal information with the companies, organizations and any individuals outside of lifelong that we work with unless we recieve your consent to do so. 
	It should be noted that the laws of certain governments require us to share certain types of data. You will, however, be informed of these requirements should you request it.
