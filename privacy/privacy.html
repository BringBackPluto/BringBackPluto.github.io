<h3>
	The types of information we collect as you use our application
</h3>
<p> 
	The advantages of our application are best demonstrated when we can optimize our services depending on the preferences of our users. This is achieved through the collection of various types of information, ranging from superficial data such as the language you speak and your age, to more personalized data such as which region you reside, your personality traits or what activities you might find interesting.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
	The types of activity we may collect include(at your discretion, as always):
</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your location data</li>
		<li>Activity preferences</li>
		<li>Interactions with content</li>
		<li>Answers to surveys and questionnaires</li>
		<li>Your interactions with family and friends</li>
		<li>The degrees of success of recommendations</li>
		<li>Activity on third-party sites and apps that share our services</li>

<h3>Maintaining and improving our services</h3>
<p>
	Your information is also used to ensure our application is working as intended, such as tracking inconsistencies in our data analysis or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. We use your information to make improvements to our application — for example, understanding which sports are most enjoyed by people of various age groups terms helps us improve our activity recommendations on our application.

<h3>Providing personalized services</h3>

				<h3>Providing personalized services</h3>
				<p>
					We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. 

					Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

				<h3>Developing new services</h3>
				<p>
					We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding that people lacked methods of connecting with those with similar interests and life stages made us create the social messaging matching option.
