<h3>
	The types of information we collect as you use our application
</h3>
<p> 
	The advantages of our application are best demonstrated when we can optimize our services depending on the preferences of our users. This is achieved through the collection of various types of information, ranging from superficial data such as the language you speak and your age, to more personalized data such as which region you reside, your personality traits or what activities you might find interesting.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
	The types of activity we may collect include(at your discretion, as always):
</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your location data</li>
		<li>Activity preferences</li>
		<li>Interactions with content</li>
		<li>Answers to surveys and questionnaires</li>
		<li>Your interactions with family and friends</li>
		<li>The degrees of success of recommendations</li>
		<li>Activity on third-party sites and apps that share our services</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<br>

<h3>Maintaining and improving our services</h3>
<p>
	Your information is also used to ensure our application is working as intended, such as tracking inconsistencies in our data analysis or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. We use your information to make improvements to our application â€” for example, understanding which sports are most enjoyed by people of various age groups terms helps us improve our activity recommendations on our application.

<h3>
	You always have control over what information we collect and how it's used
</h3>
<p>
	You can always visit the activity controls of our application to chose what information we collect and what permissions are given in terms of the use of that information. If you want to have all the features of our application that come with personalized features without having your information being processed securely by our centralized systems, that's perfectly cool with us. Just visit the dashboard to manage the specific information disclosed by each activity and action you do.
	You may also duplicate the information in your lifelong account so that you may export it for use outside our application. You can also request data from us that you may also use free of charge to analyze for any percieved issues you may have.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
	Sharing your information
</h3>
<p>
	Many of our services allow you to share information with others. For example, when you chose to utilize our communications feature you can share the activities you do or keep it hidden from others. You can also share basic personality traits determined by our A.I. tests, though by making this information accessible, it becomes accessible to anybody in your friends circle.
	We also do not share your personal information with the companies, organizations and any individuals outside of lifelong that we work with unless we recieve your consent to do so. 
	It should be noted that the laws of certain governments require us to share certain types of data. You will, however, be informed of these requirements should you request it.
